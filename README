This is a plugin for HunterPie (https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie) that synchronizes Part and Ailment data between clients.
The server is open source and available here: https://github.com/Kaedras/mhwsync
It is currently deployed on a free Heroku dyno, so there could be performance issues if the number of users becomes too high.

Please note that this plugin has not undergone extensive testing yet as I can't test it properly without the help of other players.
Additionally updating HunterPie could cause this plugin to stop working, and there could be incompatibility with the master branch as I'm currently using the beta branch.

Installation:
(1) Download the latest Release from here: https://github.com/Kaedras/HunterPie-SyncPlugin/releases
(2) Extract the contents to your HunterPie folder
