I've just released an update, the plugin should be working now, but it needs more testing. If you encounter any issues please report them by either opening an issue on github or by contacting me on discord (kaedras#8880).

Update: Thanks to recent changes to HunterPie the plugin is now easier to work on. I will release an updated version soon.

The plugin is currently causing several issues without providing the intended functionality, therefore I've shut down the server until they are resolved.<br><br>



Description:
--------------
This is a plugin for [HunterPie](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie) that synchronizes Part and Ailment data between clients.

The server is open source and available [here](https://github.com/Kaedras/mhwsync).<br>
It is currently deployed on a free Heroku dyno, so there could be performance issues if the number of users becomes too high.

Please note that this plugin has not undergone extensive testing yet as I can't test it properly without the help of other players.

Installation:
---------------
Download [module.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaedras/HunterPie-SyncPlugin/master/module.json) and drag the file into you HunterPie application window.
