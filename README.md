Update: Thanks to recent changes to HunterPie the plugin is now easier to work on. I will release an updated version soon.

01/11/2020

The plugin is currently causing several issues without providing the intended functionality, therefore I've shut down the server until they are resolved.<br><br>



Description:
--------------
This is a plugin for [HunterPie](https://github.com/Haato3o/HunterPie) that synchronizes Part and Ailment data between clients.

The server is open source and available [here](https://github.com/Kaedras/mhwsync).<br>
It is currently deployed on a free Heroku dyno, so there could be performance issues if the number of users becomes too high.

Please note that this plugin has not undergone extensive testing yet as I can't test it properly without the help of other players.

Installation:
---------------
- Method 1:
	- Download [module.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaedras/HunterPie-SyncPlugin/master/module.json) and drag the file into you HunterPie application window.
- Method 2:
	- Download the [zipped version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kaedras/HunterPie-SyncPlugin/master/Release.zip) and extract it to your HunterPie folder.
